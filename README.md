## Instructions

1. Read Chapters 2 & 3 of [Pro Git][ProGit]. The chapters are short.
2. Answer these questions using [Markdown format][markdown-cheatsheet] (also [Github Markdown][github-markdown]). 
3. Place your answers between lines beginning with 3 backquotes, which tells Markdown it should be unformatted text, and write only the commands you would type (**no** shell prompt).  E.g.:
   ```
   git status         CORRECT
   $ git status       WRONG  - you do not type "$"
   ```
4. Indent the 3 backquotes so they line up with the question text (3 leading spaces) so Markdown formats you answer as part of the numbered item.
   Example:
   ```
   git init
   ```  
5. **Test that your answers are correct!** There is **no excuse** for incorrect answers since you can test your answers by experimentation.      
6. Verify that your Markdown formatting is correct -- points deducted for bad formatting. VS Code and IntelliJ have markdown previewers. You should also preview it on Github, since Github Markdown is a bit non-standard.

**TODO**: Delete these instructions before you submit your work. Points deducted for each "TODO" in this file.

#### Note on Paths

In this file, directory paths are written with a forward slash as on MacOS, Linux, and the Windows-Bash shell: `/dir1/dir2/somefile`.    


## Basics

1. When using Git locally, what are these?  Define each one in a sentence
   * Staging area -  single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
   * Working copy - a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the ‚Äúindex‚Äù, but the phrase ‚Äústaging area‚Äù works just as well.
   * master - default branch
   * HEAD - The HEAD is a reference that points to the master.

2. When you install git on a new machxine (or in a new user account) you should perform these 2 git commands to tell git your name and email.  These values are used in commits that you make:
   ```
   git config --global user.name
   git config --global user.email

   ```

3. There are 2 ways to create a local Git repository.  Briefly descibe each one:
   - git init
   - git clone \<url>


## Adding and Changing Things

Suppose your working copy of a repository contains these files and directories:
```
README.md
out/
    a.exe
src/a.py
    b.py
    c.py
test/
    test_a.py
    ...
```     
> TODO: Write the git command to perform each of these:

1. Add README.md and *everything* in the `src` directory to the git staging area.
   ```
   git add README.md
   git add src/
   ```

2. Add `test/test_a.py` to the staging area (but not any other files).
   ```
   git add test_a.py
   ```

3. List the names of files in the staging area.
   ```
   git status
   ```

4. Remove `README.md` from the staging area. This is **very useful** if you accidentally add something you don't want to commit.
   ```
   git rm README.md
   ```

5. Commit everything in the staging area to the repository.
   ```
   git commit -m "message"
   ```

6. In any project, there are some files and directories that you **should not** commit to git.    
   For a Python project, name *at least* files or directories that you should not commit to git:
   - .idea
   - .github
   - venv


7. Command to move all the .py files from the `src` dir to the top-level directory of this repository. This command moves them in your working copy *and* in the git repo (when you commit the change):
   ```
   git mv src/*.py .
   ```


8. In this repository, create your own `.gitignore` file that you can reuse in other Python projects.  Add everything that you think is relevant.    
   *Hint:* A good place to start is to create a new repo on Github and during the creation dialog, ask Github to make a .gitignore for Python projects. Then edit it.  Don't forget to include pytest output and MacOS junk.

   ```commandline
   touch .gitignore
   ```

## Undo Changes and Recover Files

> TODO: enter the git command to do each of these
> For questions where you are showing a command, use triple-backquote marks (as above) so the text is formatted as code.

1.  Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the `a.py` in the *local repository* (HEAD revision):
      ```commandline
      git diff HEAD HEAD^
      ```

2. Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the version in the *staging area*. (But, if a.py is not in the staging area this will compare working copy to HEAD revision):

   ```commandline
   git diff a.py
   ```

3. **View changes to be committed:** Display the differences between files in the staging area and the versions in the repository. (You can also specify a file name to compare just one file.) 
   ```commandline
   git diff --staged <file-path>
   ```

4. **Undo "git add":** If `main.py` has been added to the staging area (`git add main.py`), remove it from the staging area:

   ```commandline
   git reset main.py
   ```
   or
   ```commandline
   git restore --staged main.py
   ```
5. **Recover a file:** Command to replace your working copy of `a.py` with the most recent (HEAD) version in the repository.  This also works if you have deleted your working copy of this file.
   ```commandline
   git checkout HEAD.py
   ```

6. **Undo a commit:** Suppose you want to discard some commit(s) and move both HEAD and "master" to an earlier revision (an earlier commit)  Suppose the git commit graph looks like this (`aaaa`, etc, are the commit ids)
   ```
   aaaa ---> bbbb ---> cccc ---> dddd [HEAD -> master]
   ``` 
   The command to reset HEAD and master to the commit id `bbbb`:
   ```commandline
   git reset bbbb
   ```
7. **Checkout old code:** Using the above example, the command to replace your working copy with the files from commit with id `aaaa`:
   ```
   get checkout aaaa
   ```
    Note:
    - Git won't let you do this if you have uncommitted changes to any "tracked" files.
    - Untracked files are ignored, so after doing this command they will still be in your working copy.
 

## Viewing Commits

1. Show the history of commits, using one line per commit:
   ```
   git log --oneline
   ```
   Some versions of git have an *alias* "log1" for this (`git log1`).

2. Show the history (as above) including *all* branches in the repository and include a graph connecting the commits:
   ```
   git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
   ```


3. List all the files in the current branch of the repository:
   ```
   git ls-tree --name-only HEAD
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   .gitignore
   README.md
   a.py
   b.py
   test/test_a.py
   test/test_b.py
   ```


## Branch and Merge

1. create new branch and move HEAD to new one
   ```commandline
   git checkout -b <name>
   ```
2. merge file
   ```commandline
   git merge <id-branch>
   ```
3. delete branch
   ```commandline
   git branch -d
   ```
4. Rename the branch locally
   ```commandline
   git branch --move
   ```

## Favorites

> TODO: Describe *at least* 1 task that you would like to remember, and the git command(s) to do it.

1.upload your local commits to a remote repository
   ```commandline
   git push
   ```
